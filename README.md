# Communication Protocols 🌐

## USART Protocol

The `USART` (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) protocol is a widely used serial communication method in embedded systems. It enables the transmission and reception of data between devices asynchronously or synchronously and is commonly used for communication between microcontrollers, computers, and other devices.

## SPI Protocol

The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol is a popular serial communication protocol used in embedded systems to communicate with peripherals such as sensors, displays, and memory chips. It facilitates full-duplex synchronous communication between a master and one or more slave devices.

## I2C Protocol

The I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol is another widely used serial communication protocol in embedded systems. It allows data transmission between a master device and one or more slave devices in a synchronous and half-duplex manner. I2C is frequently used to communicate with sensors, displays, and memory chips.
